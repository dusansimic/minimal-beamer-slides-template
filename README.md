# minimal-beamer-talk-template

This repository contains a minimal template for LaTeX Beamer talks. I extracted
this from my talks as I found the styling very nice and focused on the content.
All of the default navigation mumbo jumbo has been removed. It uses *Fira Sans*
and *Fira Code* throughout.

It is configured to produce two PDFs, one with notes and one without. The notes
are placed on the right of the main content, in a double-width PDF. You can use
[SplitShow](https://github.com/mpflanzer/splitshow) in OS X and
[pdfpc](https://pdfpc.github.io/) in Linux to display the slides on an external
monitor and your notes on your laptop screen.

## Samples

* [Slides With Notes](samples/slides.pdf)
* [Slides Without Notes](samples/slides-no-notes.pdf)

## Usage

1. Clone this repository and delete the `.git` directory, or just download the
  files.
1. Remove the `samples` directory.
1. Start editing `src/metadata.tex` and `src/slides.tex` as described below.
1. Run `make` or `make watch` (see [Build](#build)).

### Metadata

The file `src/slides.tex` contains the data needed to create the title page
and the Twitter handle in the footer. The default one includes
`src/graphics/logo.png`, a placeholder which you can either remove or replace.

### Slides

The file `src/slides.tex` is where you write your slides. The template includes
some handy commands for the things I use regularly, like big centered headings
and emphasized short texts.

The first slide uses `\titlepage`, you can leave that as is.


```latex
\begin{frame}
  \titlepage
  \note[item]{All right, here we go.}
\end{frame}
```

You can either use `\note[item]{...}` like in the previous example, or the
custom `\notelist` command:

```latex
\begin{frame}
  \notelist{
    \item A bit easier, I think
  }
\end{frame}
```

There's three custom commands for centered text:

* `\singletitle` for section titles
* `\singlesubheading` for sub-sections
* `\singletext` for emphasizing a short quote or statement

For including text, the template favors the `listings` package together with an
adaptation of the [Paramount color scheme](https://wickstrom.tech/programming/2016/05/15/paramount-color-scheme-for-vim.html).

```latex
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Code Listing}
  \lstinputlisting[language=c]{src/listings/hello.c}
  \notelist{
    \item Hello world is a cool example
  }
\end{frame}
```

### Dark Theme

If you want a dark theme for your slides, remove the comment in `src/master.tex`
before the include:

```latex
% Uncomment to enable dark theme:
%\include{src/includes/dark-theme}
```

## Build

Run `make` to produce the PDFs.

```bash
make
```

You should now have `target/slides/slides.pdf` and
`target/slides-no-notes/slides-no-notes.pdf`.

If you have NodeJS you can also run the watched build:

```bash
make watch
```
